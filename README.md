"Method 2" is in km. You can tell since it uses the value 6371, which is the approx radius of the Earth in kilometres.

To instead get the result in miles, just substitute the value 3959, which is the radius of the Earth in miles.

"Method 1" is in neither unit; it is just an approximate/fast method of sorting by shortest distance, but it doesn't actually return a distance. It merely does a rough calculation as if the planet was a 2-dimensional grid (and therefore should be the preferred method of "Flat Earthers").
